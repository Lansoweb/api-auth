This library provides a PHP middleware for api authentication.

### Installation

```shell
composer require los/api-auth
```

### Usage

Using PSR-11 containers, use the provided factories and define factories for each requirement:
```php
return [
    \Los\ApiAuth\ApiAuth::class => \Los\ApiAuth\ApiAuthFactory::class,
    \Los\ApiAuth\Strategy\Strategy::class => \Los\ApiAuth\Strategy\XApiKeyHeader::class,
    \Los\ApiAuth\Authenticator\Authenticator::class => \Los\ApiAuth\Authenticator\ArrayAuthenticatorFactory::class,
    \Los\ApiAuth\Output\Output::class => \Los\ApiAuth\Output\ProblemDetailsOutputFactory::class,
];
```

Then add the middleware to you pipeline:
```php
$app->pipe(\Los\ApiAuth\ApiAuth::class);
```

If successful, the middleware will register a new Request attribute ```Los\ApiAuth\Authenticator\Authenticator``` with the identity found, so you can know which identity is authorized in the request.

If using [laminas](https://getlaminas.org), you can create a config/autoload/api-auth.global.php:
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Los\ApiAuth\ApiAuth;
use Los\ApiAuth\ApiAuthFactory;
use Los\ApiAuth\Authenticator\ArrayAuthenticatorFactory;
use Los\ApiAuth\Authenticator\Authenticator;
use Los\ApiAuth\Output\Output;
use Los\ApiAuth\Output\ProblemDetailsOutputFactory;
use Los\ApiAuth\Strategy\BasicAuthorizationHeader;
use Los\ApiAuth\Strategy\Strategy;

return [
    'dependencies' => [
        'invokables' => [
            Strategy::class => BasicAuthorizationHeader::class,
        ],
        'factories'  => [
            ApiAuth::class       => ApiAuthFactory::class,
            Authenticator::class => ArrayAuthenticatorFactory::class,
            Output::class        => ProblemDetailsOutputFactory::class,
        ],
    ],
    'api-auth'     => [
        'ignorePaths' => ['/health'], 
        'identities'  => ['707cd425-0a60-4d36-b2e8-c9fd7fc0f194' => '208bfbc5-e705-46b1-aec0-2b0e1b4156ad'],
    ],
];

```
### Strategies

Included:
* XApiKeyHeader: extracts the identity from the X-Api-Key header
* CustomHeader: extracts the identity from a custom header
* AuthorizationHeader: extracts the identity and credential from the Authorization header
* Aggregate: you can add as many strategies as you want, and it will return the first which succeeds
* Strategy interface to implement your own strategies

### Authenticator

Included:
* ArrayAuthenticator: validates the identity/credential against a simple array. The default is ```['api-auth']['identities'] ```
* Authenticator interface to implement your own, e.g. database

### Output

Included:
* ProblemDetailOutput: the json response output will be generated using the mezzio/problem-details package, which needs to be required in your composer.json
* ExceptionOutput: it will just throw the exception, and you can handle it in other middleware 
* Output interface to implement your own, e.g. HTML, XML
